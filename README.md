2025:
(Nov-Dec)
Themes I made cause I was bored and wanted to try out and test out things online. I had always been a fan of customization and especially heavy and hardcore customization, hence causing me to work for 1-2 days consistently on this project of curating 3 beautiful themes that I think love pretty good for a begineer who is just trying out this online for the first time. 
I had my share of fun and since I wasn't under the snow with all the school pressure... I think I can make more and curate better and maybe next time dynamic themes
